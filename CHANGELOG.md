## Development Roadmap & Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities: In-House Development

**📋 See comprehensive task list in:** `IN_HOUSE_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

All external service integrations (Stripe, Twilio, SendGrid) are **already implemented** in the codebase. The following tasks can be completed entirely in-house without any paid subscriptions:

#### Phase 1: Local Environment (1-2 days) - P0
- Set up local MongoDB or free MongoDB Atlas M0 cluster
- Configure environment variables for local development
- Disable external services (set EMAIL_ENABLED=false, SMS_ENABLED=false)
- Create initial admin user
- Verify application starts successfully

#### Phase 2: Mock External Services (2-3 days) - P0
- Install MailHog for local email testing (free, Docker-based)
- Create MockEmailService, MockSmsService, MockStripeService
- Build mock payment page in frontend
- Test complete booking flow with mocked payment

#### Phase 3: Core Testing (3-5 days) - P1
- Test authentication and JWT flows
- Test availability calculation and booking
- Test psychologist dashboard and appointments
- Test messaging system
- Manual testing of all features

#### Phase 4: Messaging Frontend (2-3 days) - P1
- Implement MessagesPage component (currently placeholder)
- Build conversation list and thread view UI
- Integrate with backend messaging APIs
- Test real-time messaging flow

#### Phase 5: Testing Infrastructure (3-5 days) - P1
- Write unit tests for all services (target: 80%+ coverage)
- Write integration tests for all controllers
- Write frontend component tests
- Set up test database with fixtures
- Configure CI test pipeline

#### Phase 6: UI/UX Polish (3-5 days) - P2
- Improve patient portal (search, filters, better booking UX)
- Improve psychologist portal (charts, calendar view, bulk actions)
- Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add toast notifications for user feedback
- Mobile responsiveness improvements

#### Phase 7: Code Quality (3-5 days) - P2
- Extract common utilities and hooks
- Improve error handling and validation
- Add request/response logging
- Refactor long methods
- Add comprehensive JavaDoc and TSDoc comments

#### Phase 8: Docker & E2E Testing (2-3 days) - P1
- Complete Docker Compose configuration
- Create optimized Dockerfiles
- Test Docker deployment locally
- End-to-end testing of user journeys
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

**Estimated Timeline: 4-6 weeks of in-house development**

### Deferred: External Vendor Configuration

These integrations are **already built** and only require API keys when ready for production:

#### Stripe Payment Processing
- Production Stripe account setup
- Configure live API keys in `.env`
- Set up webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard
- Test with real payment cards
- Configure refund policies

#### Twilio SMS Service
- Twilio account setup
- Australian phone number provisioning
- Configure credentials in `.env`
- Test SMS delivery
- Monitor costs and optimize

#### SendGrid Email Service
- SendGrid account setup (or use Gmail App Passwords)
- Domain verification
- Configure API key in `.env`
- Test email deliverability
- Monitor reputation and bounces

#### Production Deployment
- AWS/Azure/GCP account setup
- MongoDB Atlas production cluster (M10+)
- EC2 Auto Scaling Group or App Service
- S3 + CloudFront for frontend
- Load balancer configuration
- CI/CD pipeline to production
